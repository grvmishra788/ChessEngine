# ChessEngine
A functional Chess playing application developed using Python.

## Background
I enjoy playing chess in my free time. Recently, I came across a video tutorial playlist by Eddie Sharick on Youtube, where he implemented a chess engine using Python. Interested in his tutorial, I decided to implement his ideas with minor modifications. Hence, I built this repository. 
To see Eddie's video tutorials, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnYui0e73Rs&list=PLBwF487qi8MGU81nDGaeNE1EnNEPYWKY_)

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run [main.py](https://github.com/grvmishra788/ChessEngine/blob/main/main.py)

## App walk-through
Here's a demo of the application, showing a basic Checkmate in chess called [Scholar's mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar%27s_mate)<br/> <br/>
